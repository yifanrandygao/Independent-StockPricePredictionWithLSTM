# Independent-StockPricePredictionWithLSTM

If you are interested in leveraging deep learning to predict stock price, check this notebook. 

Here, I use a simple three layers LSTM model to predict the stock price for Facebook. 

The purpose of this notebook is not trying to challenge the traditional ways to predict the market.
Rather, it shows how deep learning could be adopted to predict the market movement in a straightforward way. Enjoy!
